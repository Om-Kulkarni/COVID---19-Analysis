# COVID---19-Analysis

There is a dataset on ICMR(Indian Council of Medical Research) Lab Locations.

I am unawere of any library that helps to plot points based on geographic location in India
It can be done by converting pincodes to approx Lats and Longs and then ploting them on the map but the code for conversion now becomes the choke point

If anyone of you guys have any idea about ploting points on map, Just alter that code
